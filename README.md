## Introduction
***A or B*** is a multi user web aplication. The point of this application is for users to pose questions with two possible answers and have other users vote on which answer is better. Thw website was created as my seccond project at **General Assembly** using front and back end Javascript, html, embeded javascript, and Scss. An online version of my game can be found [here] (#) The code can be viewed [here] (https://github.com/TomaszRadwanski/wdi-project-2).

## How the website works
To use the website fully a user must sign up and create an account. Once an account has been created then the user can create, edit, and vote on diffferent questions.

## Project Brief
The goal of the project was to create a restful web application witch had a log in and log out function.

##How it was made 
**A or B** was made over the period of a week while at the **WDI-26 General Assembly** course. To assist me in completing this project I used a organization website called [Trello] (www.trello.com). The languages used were html, css, javascript. However, there were many packages added to these as to make the website look better and simplyfy the process. To style the website I use two css frameworks 1. Matirialize 2. Fullplage Js.
